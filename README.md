### ✅ Tips:

- Replace `"yourusername"` and placeholder links with your actual GitHub and email.
- Add a screenshot image (`screenshot.png`) inside the `/assets/` folder to show off the UI.
- If your project is hosted live, include a `🔗 Live Demo` section with the deployed link.

Would you like me to add a "Live Demo", "Changelog", or setup instructions for backend as well?
